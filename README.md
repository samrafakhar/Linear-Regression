Linear Regression using Python 


## Part 1: Linear Regression with One Variable
In the python notebook (Linear_Regression_With_One_Variable.ipynb) we have implemented linear regression with one Variable. Population of the city is our independent variable and we are trying to predict the value of Profit according to the Population using gradient descent. Image of the training data is shown below:

The cost function is as follows:

The best fit line after performing gradient descent is shown below:

## Part 2: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
Linear Regression with Multiple Variables is performed in two ways. Gradient descent and normal equation. Both the formulas are shown below:


Gradient Descent:

Normal Equation:

Convergence of both the methods is almost the same
