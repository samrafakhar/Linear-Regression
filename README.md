# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression using Python 

## Part 1: Linear Regression with One Variable
Suppose you are the Chief Executive Officer of a bakery and are considering diﬀerent cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has outlets in various cities and you have data for proﬁts and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.

### Plotting Data

### Gradient Descent

## Part 2: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
### Feature Normalization
By looking at the data values, note that house sizes are about 1000 times the number of bedrooms. When features diﬀer by orders of magnitude, ﬁrst performing feature scaling can make gradient descent converge much more quickly.

•	Subtract the mean value of each feature from the dataset.

•	After subtracting the mean, additionally scale (divide) the feature values by their respective “standard deviations.”
